The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to ADK-TS Samples. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

Before contributing, we encourage you to read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## 💣 Reporting Issues

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for existing samples. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating a new issue, **[check existing issues](https://github.com/IQAIcom/adk-ts-samples/issues)** to see if the report exists. If it does, go through the discussion thread and leave a comment instead of opening a new one.

If you find a **Closed** issue that is the same as what you are experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

When reporting issues with samples, be sure to include:

- **Which sample project** you're working with
- **Clear title and description** of the issue
- **Exact steps to reproduce** the bug
- **Your environment details** (Node.js version, OS, package manager)
- **Expected vs. actual behavior**
- **Error logs or screenshots** if applicable

## 🛠 Requesting New Samples

We track new sample requests as GitHub issues using the "Sample Request" template.

Before submitting a new sample request, **[check existing issues](https://github.com/IQAIcom/adk-ts-samples/issues)** to see if a similar request already exists.

A good sample request should include:

- **Clear description** of the agent or use case you'd like to see
- **Project type** (Web app, CLI tool, API service, etc.)
- **Specific ADK-TS features** you want demonstrated
- **Target complexity level** (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
- **Industry or domain focus** if applicable

## ✨ Understanding the Project

Before contributing to the project, you need to understand the repository structure and how samples are organized.

<span id="prerequisites"></span>

### Prerequisites

To contribute samples to this repository, you should have:

- **Node.js 18+** installed
- **npm, yarn, or pnpm** as your package manager
- **TypeScript knowledge** and familiarity with ADK-TS
- **ADK-TS installed** - see the [ADK-TS Installation Guide](https://adk.iqai.com/docs/framework/get-started/installation)

<span id="repository-structure"></span>

### Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

```text
├── agents/                    # Sample agent projects
│   ├── README.md             # Setup and testing guide
│   └── [sample-projects]/    # Individual example projects
├── .github/                  # GitHub templates and workflows
└── README.md               # Main repository README
```

Each sample project should be self-contained with its own:

- README with setup instructions
- package.json with dependencies
- Source code demonstrating ADK-TS usage
- Example configuration files
